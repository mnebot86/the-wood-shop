          The Wood Shop was founded in 2021 by husband and wife team, Marcus and
          Chastity Woodson. Hailing from the Mississippi Gulf Coast, the
          Woodsons traveled the country before arriving in Tallahassee in 2020
          with their two sons, Carter and Bryce. Marcus, a defensive backs coach
          at Florida State University (FSU), is passionate about young people
          and creating a safe community for all Tallahassee college students,
          residents, and children. The Shop is meant to be a place to chill out,
          gain some wisdom, look good, and ultimately feel good.We’re all about family at the Wood Shop, and you’re a part of it!
          Thanks for being a part of our club.
